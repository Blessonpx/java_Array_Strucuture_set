This project shows how you can create an Multi-Lookup Array from A CSV file 
This will upload the data in a Array Struture onto which you can do a multi-column Lookup
e.g. Given a file that has 3 columns namely Customer_Name;Reference_lookup_Name; Final Output 

You want to store the file in a data-structure where you can make a 2 column search ; say on Customer_Name and Reference_lookup_Name and return the value of Final_Output column

All this without use of sql or re-reading the file everytime
